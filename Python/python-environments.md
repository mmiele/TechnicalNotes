# Python Environnments

A Python environment is a **context** in which you run Python code and includes one of the following environments:

- global
- virtual
- [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)

An environment consists of:

- an interpreter
- a library (typically the Python Standard Library)
- a set of installed packages

> Note.
> These components together determine which language constructs and syntax are valid, what operating-system functionality you can access, and which packages you can use.

In Visual Studio on Windows, you use the Python Environments window, as described in this article, to manage environments and select one as the default for new projects. Other aspects of environments are found in the following articles:
For any given project, you can select a specific environment rather than use the default.
For details on creating and using virtual environments for Python projects, see Use virtual environments.
If you want to install packages in an environment, refer to the Packages tab reference.
To install another Python interpreter, see Install Python interpreters. In general, if you download and run an installer for a mainline Python distribution, Visual Studio detects that new installation and the environment appears in the Python Environments window and can be selected for projects.
