# Network notes


## Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model

The OSI Model was designed in 1977 and is part of the ISO specifications since 1984.
Each OSI layer serves a unique task for network communication. For more information, see [OSI Model](https://osi-model.com/). 


### Network layer (Layer 3)

The **network layer** (aka packet level, layer 3 of the OSI model) provides services for switching connections and packet-oriented services for the relaying of data packets. The data transmission in both cases will go over the entire communication network and includes the route search (routing) between the network nodes. Because not always a direct communication between the sender and the target is possible, packets must be forwarded by nodes that are on the way. Next mediated packets do not reach the higher layers, but are provided with a new intermediate target and sent to the next node. For more informaiton, see [OSI Layer 3 - Network Layer](https://osi-model.com/network-layer/).
