# Xmas Sample
More than anything this sample shows the steps to use the virtual environment to build and run the example.

1. In our command terminal go to the directory that contain the virtual environment, for example: `cd C:\Users\<user name>\Python>`,
1. Activate the environment: `venv\Scripts\activate`.
1. Go to the directory where the sample is, for example: `cd examples\xmas`.
1. Make sure to install the required packages by executing this command:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`.
1. Run the sample, by executing this command: `python xmas-tree.py`.
You get the following output:
