# P4 language

Programming Protocol-independent Packet Processors (P4, in other word PPPP that is P4) is a domain-specific language for network devices, specifying how data plane devices (switches, NICs, routers, filters, etc.) process packets. For more information, see P4 Open-Source Programming Language.


## Getting started with P4

Suggested by Chris

1.  Hi Michael, you'll need a Linux machine - I installed Virtualbox
    hypervisor under Windows and then install an Ubuntu 20.04 VM. it\'s
    a bit of a process. All the p4 stuff runs exclusively on Linux
    AFAIK.

2.  Once you have a VM, you might visit
    [[https://github.com/jafingerhut/p4-guide]{.underline}](https://github.com/jafingerhut/p4-guide),
    it\'s one of the best resources I\'m aware of. Andy Fingerhut put it
    together as a personal project. He\'s a big player in the p4
    community and attends DASH meetings.

3.  If you follow Andy\'s instructions, you\'ll end up installing a huge
    pile of tools with one convenient script.

    a.  You need more than just the compiler to do anything useful.

    b.  You need something to run the output on - e.g., the bmv2
        simulator. Then you\'ll need example programs, which Andy\'s
        repo has in abundance.
