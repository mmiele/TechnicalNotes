# Add OAuth to a bot

This topic uses Azure Bot Service authentication capabilities, which makes easier to develop a bot which can be authenticated by various identity providers such as Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), GitHub, Uber, and so on.

## Overview

In this tutorial you will create a sample bot that connects to Microsoft Graph using an Azure AD authentication. You will use code from a GitHub repository, and this tutorial describes how to set the things up. You will learn how to:

- [Create a bot and an authentication application](#Create-a-bot-and-an-authentication-application)
- [Prepare the bot sample code](#Prepare-the-bot-sample-code)
- [Use the emulator to test the bot](#Use-the-emulator-to-test-the-bot)

The finished bot performs a few simple tasks against an Azure AD application, such as checking and sending an email, or displaying who you are and who your manager is. To do this, your bot will use a token from an Azure AD application against the `Microsoft.Graph` library.
