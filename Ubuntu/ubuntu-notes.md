> [!NOTE]
> I had login problems when trying to access my GitHub repo. To solve the issue, I created a personal access token (PAT) and use it instead of the password to login. For more information, see [Creating a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).



## How to Install VirtualBox on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

### What is VirtualBox?
VirtualBox is a free, open-source and cross-platform software that lets you create, run, and manage **virtual machines** (VMs) on your computer.  

- With Oracle VM VirtualBox you can create one or more VMs on a single physical server. 
- Virtual machines are computers that use the hardware components of the host computer, each running its own operating system. 
- VirtualBox supports the installation of MS Windows, Linux, BDS, and MS-DOS on the installed VMs.

Below we'll explain how to install a VirtualBox on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS  system using the CLI commands.


Open a terminal window and execute the commands shown below.

In order to install the latest VirtualBox, you need to have the **Multiverse** repository enabled on your system. By default this repository is disabled. Enter the following command as root in order to enable the repository and also update your systemâ€™s repository index with that on the internet. 

```cmd
sudo add-apt-repository multiverse && sudo apt-get update
```
When running the previous command, if you get the error `add-apt-repository` command not found, execute the following command first:

```cmd
sudo apt install software-properties-common
```
Now, enter the following command to install VirtualBox:

```cmd
sudo apt install virtualbox
```
You can launch VirtualBox directly through the terminal by entering the following command:

```cmd
virtualbox
```
Exit the Terminal by entering this command:

```cmd
exit
```
