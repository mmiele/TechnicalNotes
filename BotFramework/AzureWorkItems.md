## Azure work items

The support team based on customer's feedback create the Azure work items that you can find at this location: [Suppportability docs](https://fuselabs.visualstudio.com/BotFramework/_queries/query-edit/e8da61e6-fe6d-4218-9830-fd7bcd6a15ae/).  

Each work item is a link to the related work item, for example:
[[CSS][OAuthCards] Improve documentation for OAuth Connection Settings](https://fuselabs.visualstudio.com/BotFramework/_workitems/edit/26907). When you click the link, it takes you to the work item page. The page usually contains the repro steps with the explanation of the problems and links to the affected article and the related Incident Management (ICM) ticket. 
In the ICM ticket you may find further explanation and perhaps the solution of the issue. The previous work item is connected to this [ICM ticket](https://icm.ad.msft.net/imp/v3/incidents/details/95373447/home).  
Some work items contains also link to service desk item with further info and/or solution. 
> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you cannot access the ICM ticket or the Service desk item, you need to ask for permission: [Service desk](https://servicedesk.microsoft.com/) and [ICM](https://icm.ad.msft.net/imp/v3/incidents/search/advanced).
